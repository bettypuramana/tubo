                            beside acquiring top-of-the-line rigs and technology, the company chose to invest in its
                            people. Tubo implemented an extensive training plan that addressed every task, the necessary
                            skills, and potential safety hazards, ensuring safe and successful delivery, reinforced with
                            industry-recognized certifications.</li>
